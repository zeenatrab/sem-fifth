Thank you so much. That's so nice. Isn't he a great guy. He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it. It's just not fair. 
And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens 
United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party. Also, also the people of Iowa. They have something in common. 
Hard-working people.
