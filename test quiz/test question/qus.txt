You are given the following piece of code for forward propagation through a single hidden layer in a neural network. This layer uses the sigmoid activation. Identify and correct the error.

import numpy as np 

def forward_prop(W, a_prev, b):

                 z = W*a_prev + b 

                 a = 1/(1+np.exp(-z)) #sigmoid 

return a

Answer: 
z = np.matmul(W, a prev) + b OR z = np.dot(W, a prev) + b
